Chadwick:	I hope you have finally accepted that our house is better than yours.

Leta:	Just because you won this match doesn't prove anything!

Chadwick:	Well, you can believe whatever you want... but it won't change the reality.

Leta:	As a matter of fact, I can...I challenge you for a duel battle.

Chadwick:	Oh no, not this again. You are such a sore loser! You just can't accept your defeat, can you?

Chadwick:	Fine! If this will get you to a stop, then okay. Let's just get over with it. And maybe then, finally, you'll stop bragging about your house and quit your vain challenges...

Leta:	Well you won't even get a chance to win this time! So be prepared for your annihilation, Noobie.
